2004-06-28  Mark Lindner  <markl@neuromancer>

	* gaim_plugin/talkfilters.c - Incorporated bug fix submitted by a user.
	  The bug caused the IM to only be filtered locally (not sent in

2003-02-13  Mark Lindner  <markl@dystance.net>

	* *.l - Made a fix so that compilation doesn't fail with older
	versions of gcc: moved declaration of _yybuf so that it's before the
	first statement in the filter function.

2003-02-11  Mark Lindner  <markl@dystance.net>

	* <multiple> - Complete overhaul of package; added automake/libtool
	support, and produce not only executables but also a library.

Thu Dec 31 17:09:45 1998  Joel N. Weber II  <devnull@melange.gnu.org>

	and bail if it isn't found.

	* src/talkfilters-1.0/Makefile.in (LIBS): Hardcode -lfl, since we
	always use flex.
